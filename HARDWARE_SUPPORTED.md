### Notes

**Most ESP32-S3 boards are supported in “dark mode”** (no screen, no LED).  
For this use case, flash the generic firmware release:  
 
**[`bluekb_firmware_v2.1.0_esp32s3_generic_dark.bin`](https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG_OR_USER>/<YOUR_REPO>/releases/tag/v2.1.0)**

After flashing, follow the instructions for **setting up a device without a screen** as described in the documentation.
