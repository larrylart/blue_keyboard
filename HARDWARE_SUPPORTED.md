### Notes

**Most ESP32-S3 boards are supported in “dark mode”** (no screen, no LED).  
If your specific board firmware is not avilable in the release, flash the generic firmware release - ie  **bluekb_firmware_v2.1.0_esp32s3_generic_dark.bin**

After flashing, follow the instructions for **setting up a device without a screen** as described in the documentation.
